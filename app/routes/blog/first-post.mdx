So, this my frist post at this personal blog, maybe some of you want to know why i do this, the answer is "simply because I'm bored".
Like super bored, no kidding, i don't know what to do, then someday I randomly visiting someone's personal blog and it's super cool, and the idea comes in mind
"why dont I make my personal blog?", so here it is.

This personal blog is created using RemixJS, TailwindCSS and MDX. Why RemixJS? RemixJS is super cool, lol.
It's a love at the first sight, but hey it doesn't mean i don't like other frameworks, of course i love them.
The next thing is TailwindCSS, i think TailwindCSS is more than enough to build this personal blog, especially with their flexibility and I love their utility-first css idea.
